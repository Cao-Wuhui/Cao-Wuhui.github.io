# üëã About Me
Hi, I‚Äôm Yixuan Cao. I‚Äôm pursuing my B.S. (2019‚Äì2023) and M.S. (2023‚Äì2026, expected) at the College of Computer Science and Software Engineering, Shenzhen University. I am advised by [Yuhong Feng](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=29WXQ_sAAAAJ) and [Xu Wang](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=XNDHhIEAAAAJ).

In 2024, I was selected as a [Huawei Developer Advocate](https://developer.huawei.com/home/program/advocates/member/7f07f1011f7d48b0bc989f8712919d79).

My research interests lie in software systems, security, and large language models. I am also a contributor to the [Linux kernel](https://www.kernel.org/) and [LLVM](https://llvm.org/) communities.
