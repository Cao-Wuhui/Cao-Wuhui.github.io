# 👋 About Me
Hi, I’m Yixuan Cao. I earned my B.S. (2019–2023) and am currently pursuing my M.S. (2023–2026, expected) at the College of Computer Science and Software Engineering, Shenzhen University. I am advised by [Yuhong Feng](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=29WXQ_sAAAAJ) and [Xu Wang](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=XNDHhIEAAAAJ). I was selected as a [Huawei Developer Advocate](https://developer.huawei.com/home/program/advocates/member/7f07f1011f7d48b0bc989f8712919d79) in 2024 and a [Huawei Cloud Student Developers (HCSD) Campus Ambassador](https://developer.huaweicloud.com/program/hcsd/personal?applicationId=046f0ef1ac31471f84b97acadc709be5) in 2025.

My research interests lie in software systems, security, and large language models. I am also a contributor to the [Linux kernel](https://www.kernel.org/) and [LLVM](https://llvm.org/) communities.
